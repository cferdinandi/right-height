# Browser Compatibility

## Supported Browsers

Right Height works in all modern browsers, and IE 9 and above.

Right Height is built with modern JavaScript APIs, and uses progressive enhancement. If the JavaScript file fails to load, or if your site is viewed on older and less capable browsers, content areas will render at their default heights.
